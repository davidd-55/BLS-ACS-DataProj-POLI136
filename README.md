# BLS-ACS-DataProj-POLI136
Python code that I used to comb through Bureau of Labor Stats and American Community Survey Data to assist in writing a politics paper that used data to drive the argument that Amazon warehousing has quantifiable social benefits and detriments in SoCal's Inland Empire.

I've attached the resulting paper with graphics to this repository. This code cannot be cloned and immediately used on another machine without modification, but feel free to do so.
